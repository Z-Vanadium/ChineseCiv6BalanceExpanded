Ahiram uses this wealth to build up many Great Merchant points, which have a large variety of uses. Ahiram also offers the Royal Tomb unique building, which is designed to generate even more gold from all those Great Merchants, but also to push towards building and purchasing scientific buildings.

		"Little is known about Ahiram of Byblos – even the period of his reign is unknown, with the current estimate being around the year 1000 BC. It’s also not truly known if he was a king, though Historians suspect that he was, or at least of a bloodline worthy of kingship. What is known is that his son, Ithobaal (not the one on Wikipedia, I\’m pretty sure that redirects to a different Ithobaal? But I’m honestly not sure, it\’s all really confusing) certainly was a King of Byblos, and that Ahiram was without a doubt incredibly wealthy. Wealthy enough to be interred in a grave fitting of kings: a sarcophagus in a Royal Shaft tomb."),
		("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_PHOE_AHIRAM_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2",
		"What can be extrapolated from this is that Ahiram was likely a very wealthy merchant and or king at a very convenient time: the end of the world. By the year 1000BC, the Late Bronze Age Collapse had come and gone. Babylon, Mycanae, and Ugarit lay in smouldering ashes, and the great empires of the day and age – Assyria, Elam, and almighty Egypt – were either dead or dying. Literacy was all but eradicated, and the general chaos had disrupted basically the entire trade route network that the Near East was built on. In short, things weren\’t great."),
		("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_PHOE_AHIRAM_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3",
		"As it happens, the apocalypse is great for business. Ahiram became an important individual in the ancient city of Byblos – once a colony of Egypt, but Egypt wasn\’t really capable of things such as territorial integrity at this point. Byblos became the foremost city of Phoenicia, which emerged after the bronze age collapse as a powerful and influential coalition of mercantile city-states. Due to the fact that all of the other major powers were still in varying degrees of hell, Phoenician power was virtually unopposed, giving it free reign to trade across the Mediterranean and Europe in a post-apocalyptic and barely-literate world. Even better, Byblos was located nearby huge forests of cedar, and wood was a resource that Egypt - being, indeed, a desert - is notably lacking in. In effect, Ahiram had many factors going for him to ensure there was literally no way he could not become insanely wealthy."),
		("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_PHOE_AHIRAM_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4",
		"A nice byproduct of getting intensely rich – as Possibly-King Ahiram would have been wont to do – was that the alphabet used by the Phoenicians spread across the resurging civilizations. This alphabet was far simpler to learn than the previous options of cuneiform and hieroglyphics, which made it quite popular with states that no longer had the ability nor interest to support the needs of a bunch of scribes. This popular new alphabet would form the basis of the modern Latin Alphabet, with the first true example being on none other than a curse inscribed on Ahiram\’s Sarcophagus. "),
		("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_PHOE_AHIRAM_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5",
		"Ahiram likely used his incredible wealth to bankroll construction within the city. His wealth is probably also the reason why his son, Ithobaal, was later made the King of Byblos. It also likely afforded him a good position on the council of Elders within Byblos, should he have not been the King of Byblos himself. "),

		"Okay, fine. Phoenician burial practices varied from city to city, as Phoenicia is more of a catch-all term for a bunch of maritime cities that worshiped the same-ish gods and had similar trading and government structures anyways. One type of grave that is commonly seen across Phoenician colonies is the Shaft Tomb, frequently used for Royals. Most of the tomb is underground, with a sarcophagus laid in a subterranean gallery. Then, this tomb is sealed with some coverstone, until some wayward archaeologist millennia later uncovers it. Ahiram's tomb, along with four other very important sarcophagi, were uncovered in a mudslide in modern Byblos, which lead to severe damage on his sarcophagus. Ahiram\’s sarcophagus in particular was inscribed with a curse meant to protect Byblos, though evidently it did not protect his tomb from being ransacked and robbed blind by graverobbers. "),
		("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_BUILDINGS_PAGE_LEADER_BUILDING_LIME_PHOE_AHIRAM_TOMB_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4",
		"It’s suspected that perhaps the Phoenicians, being originally colonies of Egypt, developed these styles of burial as the more economical version of the Pharaonic burial in Egypt (because who can really afford to build gigantic pyramids everywhere?). It seems that the Phoenicians influenced the Egyptians in their own right, as later Egyptian tombs also featured shafts and underground graves.");
