The term itself only came from Aztec squatters, meaning “Birthplace of the Gods”, or “Place where Men become Gods” (actually, not even this is 100% clear. It’s possible that the name of the place in Nahuatl is “Teohuacan”, which can mean “City of the Sun” or “Birthplace of the Sun”). The identity of its true founders has been lost to history, and all that remains are the monumental ruins of the enormous city they built and a legend even bigger than that. As a word of warning, what will follow will be incredibly convoluted, long, and represents a five-year-deep rabbit hole (or sink hole?) that I tumbled down, and still can’t make heads or tails of much of it. In addition, there is still a lot of scholarship going on, and knowing my luck there’s going to be a finding like next week or something that changes everything. So, yeah. Have fun."),

		"The history of the settlement dates back to 600 BC, though it really picks up around 200 BC. It can also be divided into four or five phases… though there was also a pre-phase. In its origins, it seems that Teotihuacan was involved in a contest of power with a few other cities, most notably Cuicuilco. During the period of around 600 BC to 200 BC, both Cuicuilco and Teotihuacan had a comparable population of around 20,000 inhabitants each. But, it seems that a number of eruptions of the Xitle and Popocatepetl volcanos covered Teotihuacan’s farmland in a layer of fertile ashes, but Cuicuilco and its farmlands in a layer of very unfertile lava. The survivors flocked to Teotihuacan and its springs, which helped kick-start the city’s development."),

		"Which leads to Period I, from 200BC to the turn of the millennium. Here in the timeline, Teotihuacan evolved from a farming settlement into a true city. The earliest buildings of the city date to this era, and many ethnicities from around Mesoamerica began to take note of the city. It is believed that this is when much of the faith of the city began to take root, giving rise to the earliest forms of the Storm God (early Tlaloc), the Feathered Serpent (early Quetzalcoatl), the War Serpent (also Quetzalcoatl?), the Flayed God (Xip Totec), and the principal deity the Great Goddess (unclear, but associated with spiders)."),

		"The first half of period II, sometimes called the Tzacualli phase is when things really started taking off, which ranges from 1 AD to around the year 150 AD. The economic pull of the city brought new immigrants and growth in, which caused the city’s population to explode to 80,000 people. These people allowed for the first great monuments to be built, especially the Temple of the Feathered Serpent and the Ciudadela complex. Scholars believe that this complex was sort of a monument to warfare and autocracy (which also doesn’t jive to me? Explanation will follow in the next paragraph), where sacrifices would take place. Over two hundred sacrifices of people were identified, all of which presumed to be the elites and warriors of Teotihuacan rather than captives of opposing armies. This is also the earliest appearance of Quetzalcoatl in all of Mesoamerica. Beneath this pyramid is a tunnel that had to be investigated by robot in 2010, which lead (after a lot of roving around) to a subchamber which MAY represent a microcosm of the Teotihuacano universe, or maybe a representation of the underworld or something. It was very strange and confusing and almost all theories about it are entirely speculation."),
		("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_LIME_TEOTIHUACAN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5",  
		"The second half of period II, sometimes called the Miccaotl phase from 150AD to 377AD, was one of reorganization and more building of monuments. It seems that the Temple of the Feathered Serpent fell in importance during this period, which some scholars have interpreted to mean that the city had been reorganized governmentally to be less militant and more collective-driven and bureaucratic. Other scholars believe that that is bogus and is a result of the first scholars putting their own hopes and dreams onto the past. This theory also states that the inhabitants of the Feathered Serpent Complex were exiled from Teotihuacan, and went on to conquer the Maya two hundred years later… but again, this is unlikely."),
		("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_LIME_TEOTIHUACAN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6",  
		"However, as the city expanded, it is very likely that some political reorganization was in order! It is likely that the Temple of the Feathered Serpent fell in importance compared to new construction around the early 300s AD. The Miccaotl phase saw the construction of the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon, as well as the aforementioned Miccaotl – the famous Avenue of the Dead. This boulevard was aligned in such a way that it corresponded to the 260-day-calendar of Mesoamerica, but also lined up with Cerro Gordo, a mountain with significance to the Storm God. During this period, the trade routes of Mesoamerica began to coalesce at Teotihuacan – a city of 100,000 is an excellent place to do business, and the end-point of a pilgrimage is an even better one."),

		"The year 378 changed everything, but the evidence of this comes not from Teotihuacan, but from the Maya world around 1000 kilometres away. 378 was the beginning year of when Siyaj K’ak’, also known as Fire is Born, was supposedly sent by the Spearthrower Owl to conquer the Maya. Tikal was toppled, and Spearthrower Owl’s son was put in place, and a number of other cities around there fell in a two-year period. At least, this is how the story goes. More on that in the Spearthrower Owl Civilopedia, but this is why Teotihuacan becoming less militant rather than more doesn’t seem to make much sense. 378 seems to be the first year of Period III, when Teotihuacan enters its classic period and really starts flexing its muscles."),

		"The Classic Period lasted from the Campaign of Fire is Born (ending in 380AD) to around the year 650. This is where the city reached its absolute maximum in terms of population – upwards of between 125,000 and 200,000 people – roughly half of everyone in the valley of Mexico lived within its borders. This period also saw renovations of old monuments with new decorations – clad in brilliant burgundy and jade, coated in magnificent but mysterious murals (and unfortunately completed unannotated by script of any kind), and with Teotihuacan’s iconic talud-tablero architecture, mimicked often in the Maya sites it bullied into submission. The military of Teotihuacan had been used to make sure that other city-states would send its tribute to Teotihuacan, and that trade would be properly directed to this city. However, it seems that this period also had a rise in inequality. The city’s class structure seemed to have stratified into three-ish groups – high elites, intermediate elites, and laborers. These laborers were not just the farmers, but also the skilled craftsman, and would live in the outer portions of the city. It seems that during this period, most of the inner city was gentrified. These outer portions also were associated with incredibly high infant mortality. It's a tale as old as time: the big city had even bigger problems, and its golden age wasn't so gold for anyone."),
		("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_LIME_TEOTIHUACAN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_9",  
		"Which finally leads to the last period, Period IV. It’s unclear which order of catastrophes occurred for Teotihuacan, but it was around this time that many of the buildings of the city were burned, and many of its sculptures shattered. The most prominent theory is that what set it off was a series of droughts and climate changes occurred in 535-536 which really set things off. Funnily enough, these changes may have been triggered by the same thing that caused Teotihuacan’s rise in the first place – a volcanic eruption, this time of the Ilopango volcano. Teotihuacan was unable to properly support its military, and thus there was a retreat of Teotihuacan’s armies, followed by a slow degrading of its trade powers. This could have resulted in a malnutrition, unrest, and famine. Seeing weakness, new upstart centers of Cholula, Xochicalco, and Cacaxtla began to jockey for status in the power void. They may have even allied and conspired to weaken Teotihuacan even further. All the while, Teotihuacan starved. The fall finally came at some point between 650 and 750, when major civic centers along the Avenue of the Dead were burned and sacked. Teotihuacan was abandoned soon after."),
		("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_LIME_TEOTIHUACAN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_10",  
		"But Teotihuacan’s legacy never truly died – its monumental ruins remained, shadowing the early Aztecs. Teotihuacan had been remembered by the appellation Tollan, the greatest city in the world. Further, it was possibly immortalized in the Legend of the Five Suns as the fourth world – the one preceding the world of the Aztecs, ruled by a Goddess of Magic and Water and Life. Its architecture, arts, religion, and military style were emulated by the Maya, the Aztecs, and other Mesoamerican groups, to the point that it remains unknown how much is original to them, and how much was foisted upon them by the Teotihuacanos. The site remained inhabited by Nahua hermits and shamans, a shrine to toppled gods, eventually being semi-repopulated by Aztecs and coming under the influence of the nascent Triple Alliance. Even when the Spaniards arrived, they could not help but be awed by the majesty of the dead city."),
