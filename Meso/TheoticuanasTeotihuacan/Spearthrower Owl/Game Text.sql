Using the Pochteca Enclave, the Teotihuacano player is able to generate yields to suit the Empire through its subservient city-states, acquired by peaceful means through religion and trade, and more forcibly through the Ehuatl Wearer. Another note on the Ehuatl Wearer - it comes early, so that you can conquer city-states quickly or influence them before anyone else can. Spearthrower Owl focuses on growing the capital as big as possible, and allowing you to work around the one-city limitation by conquering what cities needed. Be careful not to conquer every city-state, though - this would in fact undermine the other unique elements of the Civilization! Fire Is Born is quite a militant governor, but he is also able to exploit and subjugate City-States through subterfuge, and allows you to reinforce your conquered vassals.");

		"If Teotihuacan is a mystery, then the individual called the Spearthrower Owl is the enigma that is wrapped in it.

A glyph appears at a couple cities in the Yucatan peninsula, with an owl holding a spearthrower.

The Marcador Monument, raised in Tikal shortly after Fire Is Born conquered it, makes a note that a ruler named Spearthrower Owl ascended to the throne of some far-flung western kingdom (it does not specifically reference Teotihuacan, but what else could it be?) on 4 May 374, almost four years prior to the Teotihuacano invasion. He would have had to have been an adult at the time, with some birth dates being given around 364 or even before. A different stela in Tikal states that Curl Snout, the son of the august warrior-king Spearthrower Owl, ascended to the throne of Tikal in 379. The last mention in Tikal states that this glorious emperor died on 9 June 439 after a larger-than-life 65 year reign. During his reign, he presided over the period of the greatest prosperity and influence of Teotihuacan, whether it be political, military, cultural, economic, or religious."),

		"There is no evidence that Teotihuacan was ruled by any one king, especially during the (suspiciously long) period that Spearthrower Owl was purported to live. There are no royal tombs, there are no royal palaces (just noble ones, none of them stand above the rest), and there's no real depiction of any individual in particular at Teotihuacan with only one exception (we'll get to that, but it's also weird). Perhaps the Teotihuacanos were uninterested in recording their political leaders, but this doesn't really help Spearthrower Owl's case. The one exception to this is a residential compound in Teotihuacan, which has a mural that refers to a place known as 'Spearthrower Owl Hill,' which suggests that perhaps Spearthrower Owl may not have been any individual at all, but a martial patron deity of the city - perhaps even the most primal form of Huitzilopochtli, though this could be baseless speculation. Another scholar has suggested that Spearthrower Owl could be a title of an office, perhaps later deified. Another monument in Tikal makes a reference to celebrating the anniversary of Spearthrower Owl's death by 'conjuring the holy one.'"),
		("en_US", 
		"LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_TEO_OWL_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5",
		"In addition to these issues, none of the supposed Teotihuacano soldier or ruler remains are actually from the Valley of Mexico. Strontium analysis gave interesting results - many, if not all of these rulers that claimed relation to Spearthrower Owl were actually from Teotihuacan. This all makes the Spearthrower Owl narrative somewhat dubious."),
		("en_US", 
		"LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_LIME_TEO_OWL_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6",
		"But, it is not unlikely that there's a kernel of truth to this story. The politics of Teotihuacan and all of Mesoamerica had to be complex, and just as Rome and China had great statesmen, Teotihuacan could have as well. Maybe the Spearthrower Owl may have originally been a noble in the city with great political acumen and power, whose name then became an office, and then a god. Whatever the case, and whether or not he truly existed, the Spearthrower Owl cast a long shadow across the region, and his name and deeds echo through time - even faintly heard today.");

The Teotihuacanos were concerned with ensuring that Waka's maize, beans, chili peppers, avocados, chicle (a natural tree gum), and latex (wait, what?). Also importantly, Waka' had access to jade and quetzal feathers due to its harbor on the San Pedro River and its location on the North-South overland trade route, which connected South Campeche and the Petén basin - the two major Maya areas in Yucatan.
