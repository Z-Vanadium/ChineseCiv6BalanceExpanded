But where's the fun in that? Te' K'inich II brings conquest to the table - he gains science from all city damage he deals, no matter if the city is conquered or not. This will surely result in mass casualties, had it not been for another aspect of his abilities: the discovery of a technology heals all units. This way, you keep the war machine going until you arrive at the capital. The cherry on top is the eureka bonus when claiming an original capital. The easiest way to claim all of these bonuses is assailing citystates during the ancient era: they count for all of the bonuses, and will help you easily get those early technologies and begin your game strong.");

By the Early Classic, between AD 250 and 550, Caracol was tied into extensive trade networks and pan-lowland ideological systems, leading to a unified regional economy. Caracol was officially founded in AD 331 by Te' K'ab Chaak. Caracol was at first a client state of the more powerful city of Tikal, but Tikal's influence weakened during the mid-sixth century, losing control of Naranjo, located halfway between the two cities."),

		"This particular star war was the cause of the archaeologically and epigraphically demonstrated Tikal mid-Classic hiatus, which saw a decline in Tikal's population, a cessation of monument erection, and the destruction of certain monuments in the Great Plaza. This 120-year-long hiatus at Tikal occurred as Caracol's population and monumental construction increased, becoming more prosperous and cohesive. Tikal took on cultural characteristics of Caracol during this time as, even with the renewed erection of monuments at Tikal, their style mimicked that of Caracol. Te' K'inich II passed on his throne to the eldest of his two sons, Knot Ajaw.");
