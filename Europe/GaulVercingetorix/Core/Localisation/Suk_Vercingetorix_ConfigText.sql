		"The longsword was a weapon of high worth and status within the Celtic community. A warrior had to prove himself in battle many times before he was permitted to wield one. The two-handed longsword was first developed during the 8th century BC, but fell from favour before re-emerging around 450BC. It is possible that Celtic ironwork was significantly behind that of the Romans, as apparently their longswords bent very easily and had to be straightened against the ground. On the other hand, since Celtic ironworking was several centuries old, some believe that Roman accounts of this practice mistook this practise, and it was actually a ritual to ‘decommission’ defeated, dishonoured or damaged weapons."),

Such a location would have allowed the settlement to dominate nearby trade routes and may also have been important as a symbol of control of the area. While some dūnons grew from hill forts, by no means all of them had significant defensive functions. The development of dūnons was a milestone in the urbanisation of the continent as they were the first large settlements north of the Alps that could genuinely be described as towns. continued in use until the Romans began conquering Iron Age Europe. Even in the lands north of the River Danube that remained unconquered by the Romans, dūnons were abandoned by the late 1st century AD. In conquered lands, the Romans used the infrastructure of the dūnons to administer the empire, and many became full Roman towns. This often involved a change of location from the hilltop into the plain."),
